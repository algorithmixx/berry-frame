# __berry-frame__
##  A Framework for building<br/>Raspberry Pi Applications<br/>with a Web UI

	_( Gero Scholz, January 2020)_ 

<div style="clear:both"></div>

## INTRODUCTION

	__berry-frame__ is the name of a framework written in _Javascript_. 
	The applications you build with __berry-frame__ (and _Javascript_) are called _berries_.
	
	If you develop more than one application for small embedded computers you will
	quickly notice that more than 70% of your program code does not really deal
	with the application logic itself but with technical issues like accessing
	a certain device or handling communication between your Raspi and a web client.
	__berry-frame__ offers a way to separate all this generic technical stuff from the
	real application logic.
	
	__berry-frame__ is not a "graphical tool for drawing your programming logic".
	It rather believes in the power of formal, structured declarations. 
	Therefore it demands you to describe the hardware configuration of your 
	peripherals in a so-called __hardware definition file (HWD)__ with a simple 
	grammar based on JSON syntax. The HWD notation also establishes some standard 
	rules for visual representation of hardware elements in the browser UI 
	and for the general flow of information between UI elements and 
	hardware devices connected to the Raspi´s GPIO ports.

	<div class="hilight">
	As soon as things get more complex, you will have to provide some Javascript
	code (preferibly ES6 standard) to describe the logic of your application.
	The logical part of yor _berry_ works on the server. If you want to 
	customize the UI you can also add code and resource files to the client side.</div>

	### A framework, yes, but hopefully not a bed of Procrustes!
	
	Using a framework means that you have to accept some decisions 
	which were taken by the creator of __berry-frame__. While frameworks in former
	times esteemed themselves like the godfather of the application nowadays they
	try to be more modest, ideally "non obtrusive". __berry-frame__ is somewhere
	in the middle. It has a clear idea of a layered software architecture
	and takes control over hardware access and over the web server.
	But it gives you a lot of possibilities to hook into its skeleton or to extend it.
	
	<hr/>
	
	Think of __berry-frame__ being the __technical boss__ and you being the __chief of application__.
	
	<hr/>
	
	The question __How much declaration and how much dedicated coding do we want?__
	is crucial for the design of a framework like __berry-frame__.
	
	An __example__: If you have a temperature sensor you may want to watch
	its value regularly and switch a LED to ON if it is too high or light a different LED
	if it is too low. The HWD (i.e. the hardware definition file of your _berry_)
	is powerful enough to define this behavior in pure declaratory style 
	without any algorithmic coding. 
	
	In a concrete case, however, it might seem useful to trigger the over-temperature signal
	only if there were three consecutive observations (slightly) above the threshold. If the value
	exceeds the upper limit by more than 10%, however, the light should go on immediately.
	This kind of logic would be a clear candidate for specific server-side, hand written 
	application code of your _berry_.
	
	Similar rules apply to the UI. The declarations within the HWD allow you to place 
	the current value delivered by the temperature sensor somewhere on the browser screen 
	with all possibilities of CSS formatting. But if your _berry_ is a weather station 
	you probably will like to use a rich set of pictograms in addition to the numeric 
	temperature value. In that case you will have to add a new function to the client 
	which receives the current temperature value from the __berry-frame__ framework 
	and creates your desired visual representation. This may include Javascript code,
	CSS declarations, providing images and animations, sound, videos etc.

	## <a name="c1"/> 1) Main Features of __berry-frame__
	
	
	__berry-frame__ can be installed and run on a Raspberry Pi and on Windows.
	On Windows __berry-frame__ emulates the hardware peripherals ("devices") of the Raspi.
	The emulation can also be used on the Raspi itself, e.g. for replicable tests
	or if the hardware is not physically connected for some reason. 
    But do not expect too much: The emulation is an aid for development and test;
	it does not try to resemble the behavior of real hardware devices by any means.

	__berry-frame__ consists of classes which encapsulate hardware devices,
	a web server, a registration service for servers and a generic web client.

	__berry-frame__ applications (short: _berries_) are formally defined by a
	hardware definition file (HWD) and one or more Javascript classes which have 
	to be written by the application designer.

	__berry-frame__ comes with a generic web client which can display all supported hardware 
	device types in 'basic optics'. Application specific code can be added to enhance
	and customize the user interface.

	__berry-frame__ clients can connect to more than one _berry_ (server) simultaneously.
	This means that a client can work as a control center for several _berries_
	of the same type or even of different types.

	__berry-frame__ uses fast light-weight socket communication between clients and servers,
	providing full synchronisation of the physical hardware with all attached clients.
	
	__berry-frame__ works asynchronously for time-consuming hardware-related functions.

	__berry-frame__ comes with a registration service (__Berry Master__) to facilitate
	cooperation between multiple _berries_ (possibly running on different Raspis).

	__berry-frame__ is written in Javascript (ES6 syntax); the server part runs on Node.js, 
	the client part runs in the browser.

	__berry-frame__ requires no installation (apart from Node.js and some public modules).

	__berry-frame__ is reasonably fast on modern Raspi hardware. It can even be used on older models
	with acceptable performance but you will observe _very long loading times_ (~30 sec.) there, 
	possibly due to memory swapping in the loading phase. If you can accept that, 
	the performance might be ok once it is up and running.

	__berry-frame__ is open source and can be used freely (see license chapter).
	
	<div class="hilight">
	Sure, many useful features. But there must be some <b>negative points</b> as well?<p/>
	Yes. There is a <b>learning curve</b>. It is easy to build simple applications.
	But complex applications with exotic devices will require you to extend the framework.
	This means that you must understand its architecture - which requires some effort, indeed.
	<p/>
	And in spite of the many features you will probably miss one aspect: <b>security</b>.
	Berry does not help you to protect your system against evil attacks. In fact __berry-frame__ is
	very liberal; the generic web client can stop or restart the server or even
	shutdown the whole Raspi. For embedded devices it is quite normal to have
	a physical "off"-button which shuts down the whole device. But if you allow
	web connections to your machine you may want to protect such features by some kind
	of access control. Berry __will not prevent you__ from doing that, 
	but it has no built-in security features to help you with protecting your _berries_.
	
	If you want to add security aspects to the __Berry framework__: Contact the author!
	</div>

	### Why should I use __berry-frame__?

	* It makes your life easier. You only write the "net" code of your application.
	* It uses the same language (_Javascript_) on the server and on the client.
	* Running on _Windows_ during development speeds up the edit/run cycle significantly.
	* The formal hardware description is a good documentation for your project.
	  A nicely formatted version can also be shown to the user in the browser.
	* You get benefits like a REST-like API for your application without much effort.
	* You get a starting point for building cooperative Raspi applications.
	* You do not have to care about communication between server and client.
	* You get a simple UI out of the box without any client-side programming.

## <a name="c2"/> 2) How do I work with __berry-frame__?

	To build your own _berry_ you must provide a formal description of the hardware
	elements connected to the GPIOs (or USB ports) and you must provide a Javascript class 
	which describes the specific behavior of your system.

	__berry-frame__ comes with a bunch of classes which encapsulate certain types of hardware elements,
	like push buttons, LEDs, LED strips, motion sensors, speakers and microphones.
	The _lower layer_ of these encapsulating classes deals with __protocols__ like 
	digital I/O, PWM, 1-Wire, SPI and I²C. The _upper layer_ deals with sensor/actuator specifics.
	
	If the type of hardware you want to connect is already there, everything is fine.

	If you want to connect other hardware elements you will need to extend the framework
	by a class to _encapsulate your specific type of hardware_. Doing this is not too complicated.
	__And without _berry_ you would have to write very similar code anyway.__ 
	
	As said before, __berry-frame__ supports emulation of Raspi hardware elements under Windows.
	So, if you are extending the framework you will also have to provide (minimalistic) code
	to do some sort of emulation (returning random values or whatsoever).
	For a new type of hardware element, say: a motor, you will also have to provide
	a reasonable optical client representation with HTML/CSS/JS.
	
	<hr>
	Enough of theory and preambles?	Maybe you want to go to the "Installation" chapter now.
	
	But sooner or later you will notice that a good understanding of __Berry´s__ architecture
	is helpful. So maybe you better continue reading here, now?
	
	
## <a name="c3"/> 3) ARCHITECTURE

	__berry-frame__ has a layered architecture.
	Apart from the physical hardware we have three software layers:
	__Hardware Management__, __Web Service__ and the __Web User Interface__.

	```
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    PHYSICAL HARDWARE         HW	Physical Hardware connected to the Raspi
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    HARDWARE MANAGEMENT       HP	Hardware Protocol Encapsulation
                              HA	Hardware Access, Device Type Encapsulation
                              HC	Hardware Configuration and Control
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WEB SERVICE               WS	Web Server
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WEB USER INTERFACE        WC	Web Client
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ```

	More details can be seen in the following diagram:
	
	<img src="http:img/architecture.jpg" style="width:700px;margin-left:10px"/>

	
## <a name="c4"/> 4) CUSTOMIZATION 

	As can be seen in the diagram each software layer has a part that is defined by 
	the __Berry Framework__	and an (optional) part that can be added/configured	
	according to the needs of your _berry_ application (shown on the right hand side in red color).
	
	The implementation of a layer can also include publicly available 
	_third party Node.js modules_ (shown on the left hand side in orange).
	The hardware layer uses libraries for various protocols (like GPIO, I²C or SPI)
	and for certain device types (e.g. WS2801).	The web server uses libaries for http handling 
	and socket communication. The web client uses a very common library called _jquery.js_ 
	and another library called _commonmark.js_ for rendering MarkDown syntax to HTML.
	
	<img src="http:img/customize.png" style="float:right;width:300px;margin-left:10px"/>

	### Let us briefly look at each layer:

	* __HP - the protocol encapsulation__ - is fairly complete; 
	  It comprises:
	  * _GPIO_: general purpose tri-state input/output pins with configurable pull up/pull down
	  * _PWM_: hardware controlled pulse width modulation (only at supported pins)
	  * _PWM_: software controlled pulse width modulation (most other GPIO pins)
	  * _1Wire_: 1 wire protocol for sensors
	  * _SPI_: serial peripheral interface (SPI0 and SPI1), a master-slave connection
	  * _I²C_: inter-integrated circuit protocol, a more flexible and more complex master-slave connection
	* __HA - the device access layer.__ Details on the currently supported types can be found in the next chapter.
	  If you want to use a device of a type which is not yet supported you will have to add new classes
	  to this layer. This could be a stepper motor, a RFID reader using SPI or another 1-Wire sensor 
	  or whatever you need.
	* __HC - the hardware control__ - is a generic module which is mainly driven by a JSON file 
	  containing the hardware description (HWD) which you must provide. 
	  The HWD must contain all hardware elements (type and properties) of your _berry_.
	  It also contains elementary layout hints for UI representation and settings for
	  automated information flow. If you add new classes to layer HA you have to add small 
	  pieces of code to Hardware.js. in layer HC to enable the new types.
	* __WS - the web server__ - will in many cases have to be extended by a class which contains
	  the specific logic of your application. That class should be derived from "App", 
	  which is provided as a parent class by the __berry-frame__ framework. This class does Note
	  sit in the framwork directory tree. It is rather a direct part of your _berry_.
	* __WC - the web client__ - could be extended if you feel that the standard way to display
      the hardware peripherals of your _berry_ is not adequate for your needs. We recommend to 
	  separate your code from the generic web client, but right now there are no built-in mechanisms
	  for the coexistence of the generic Berry web client and your own client. In some
	  cases you may want to replace major parts of the generic client and only retain its
      functionality for socket communication.	  

	<hr/>

	If you make extensions to the framework which can be useful for others - especially in the 
	HA layer, we encourage you to contact the author so that your contribution can be added 
	to the framework.
	So, if you added support for more sensors or actuators, let us know! In such cases
	please also provide an extension to the generic client (WC) so that the new elements can
	be visualized adequately in the browser UI.
	
	You may also want to add _pure software application components_ like e.g. a _scheduler for timed tasks_
	or _abstract devices_ like a _persistent memory_ that could store configuration and calibration
	settings which survive a reboot of the Raspi.
	
	Of special interest are contributions regarding the control of _physical displays_.

## <a name="c5"/> 5) SUPPORTED DEVICE TYPES ( layer: BHA / AHA )

	* _Button_: A push button or a switch button with configurable debouncing
	* _PWDevice_: A device that can take hardware controlled pulse width signals (like a servo motor)
	* _LED_: A light emitting diode with configurable color and a flexible blinking method
	* _WS2801_: An SPI controlled strip of RGB LEDs where each LED can be individually controlled
	* _DS1820_: A One Wire thermo sensor
	* _PMU6500_: A very common motion sensor which is connected through I²C.
	* _TextInput_: A text input area (a virtual device, only available in the browser UI)
	* _Display_: A generic character display (EMULATION ONLY)
	* _Speakers_: A sound producing equipment which can be accessed through standard drivers
	* _Microphone_: A sound recording equipment which can be accessed through standard drivers
	* _FrontPanel_: A built-in device type which corresponds to the physical hardware housing
	  It is represented in the client UI as a rectangular screen area which is a base for the
      relative positioning of all other peripheral elements (device representations)
	* _Label_ : A fixed element on the front panel of a _berry_
	* _Action_ : Actions are virtual (non-physical) devices which appear ONLY in the web UI;
	  they can be used to make API calls or to assist in testing/debugging.
	  
	Device types missing: step motor (possibly connected via GPIO), more 1-wire sensors,
	force sensors, AD-converters, DA-converters, relais, .. and many more ..


## <a name="c6"/> 6) HARDWARE CONFIGURATION ( layer: BHC / AHC )

	<img src="http:img/json.png" style="float:right;width:300px;margin-left:10px"/>

	The hardware configuration for a _berry_ is described in (slightly extended) JSON notation (*.hwd files).
	The framework parses the HWD file and "builds" the hardware by assembling the necessary
	classes and connecting their information flow.
	
	The HWD provides general information about the application (like its name, type, textual description
	and revision number) and a list of its __elements__.
	
	Elements are physical parts of the hardware but can also be abstract "Actions", which appear only
	in the UI and do not have a physical correspondence.
	Apart from technical details like GPIO numbers, debounce times etc. the HWD also contains layout
	declarations for the representation of each element on the browser screen ("virtual front panel").

	HWD files allow to define simple connections between a Button and other elements like LEDs.
	Therefore in some cases you could even define a Berry application without a specific 
	application server class.

	See our "Hello" _berry_ as an example.
	
	
### 6.1) Extended JSON Syntax

	HWD uses JSON syntax. In addition the following rules apply:
	* both types of comments (double // and /* .. */) are allowed
	* attribute names must not be enclosed in quotes;
	this means that you write something like {name:"foo"} and not {"name":"foo"}
	* superfluous commas are allowed and will be ignored
	* strings can be broken into multiple lines by simply writing them line by line,
	each part enclosed with quotes
	* You must not use the percent sign (%); use "&amp;percnt;" instead


### 6.2) Basic structure
		
```
{
    title:      "A text which will appear in the web client´s head region."
                "It can contain arbitrary HTML",
    type:       "the type of the application; it should start with a capital",
    desc:       "A description of the application which is shown in the web client on user´s demand."
                "Arbitray HTML, slashes must be escaped.",
    port:       a valid (free) port number,
    appClass:   "empty OR the application class name (which should equal the application type)",
    rev:        "A string to identify the hardware revision",
    img:        "file name of an image which will be shown in the web client"
                "the image is searched in "client/hardware/<type>/",
    elms:       [ an array of Elements ]
}
```
		
	Elements are _physical_ devices of the application which are represented in the web client.
	The special elements "Action" and "Manual" are _virtual_ devices, which only exists in the web client.

	A hardware definition must contain exactly one element of type "FrontPanel". All other
	elements are (absolutely) positioned relative to this element.
	
	Element types have some basic built-in CSS formatting for the client which can be overwritten in the
	"style" attribute.


### 6.3) ELEMENT definition (GENERAL attributes):
```
{
    type:       "a valid element type like "+
                "FrontPanel,Label,"+
                "Button,LED,PWDevice,WS2801,MPU6500,TextInput,Display,Microphone,Speakers,"+
                "Manual,Action,..",
    id:         "a unique literal to identify an emement; the id is typically _not_ visible to the user",
    name:       "a name to describe the element; the name is visible to the user for most element types",
    title:      "a help text which is displayed on mouse over",
    gpio:       a GPIO/BCM number to identify the pin connected to the element,
    cable:      "a description of the cable(s) leading to the device, typically its color",
    color:      "a CSS color which applies to the representation of the lement in the web client",
    style:      "CSS definitions which describe the UI representation of the element in the web client",
    emulate:    "true if an element is not physically available; if Berry is running on Windows"+
                "this property is automatically TRUE for all elements"
}
```


### 6.4) ELEMENT definitions (SPECIFIC attributes):

```
FrontPanel: {}

Label: {}

Button: {
    debounce:    a time in msec to avoid unwanted double triggers,
    pressed: {
        elm:     "elm" OR [ "elm1","elm2", .. ],
        cmd:     "a command, must be a method supported by 'elm' },
    },
    down: {
        ..       (same attributes as "pressed")
    },
    up: {
        ..       (same attributes as "pressed")
    },
    downUp: {
        ..       (same attributes as "pressed")
    }
}
         The events "pressed","up" and "down" can be linked to one or more (other) elements;
         "downUp" applies to "down" AND "up" and should be used to avoid redundance.
         A given Button can only use one of the following combinations:
         (pressed),(up),(down),(downUp),(pressed+down),(pressed+up),(pressed+downUp)
         The "cmd" will be executed when the event fires (i.e. the user clicks/presses/releases the button)
    
LED: {
    color:       "the (CSS) color of the LED when lighted",
    interval:    the duration (msec) of a on/off cycle in a "blink" command, default: 250,
    ratio:       a percentage of ON time during blinking, default: 50,
    cycles:      number of repetitions, default: 3
    duration:    defines a limit (msec) for the blinking process (excesss cycles being ignored)
}

   speed:      the frequency (Hertz) of data transfer, rounded to a power of 2, default = 2e6,
   reverse:    can be 0 or 1.0, reverses the sequence of the LEDs,
}

Speakers: {}

Action: {
    target:    "the id of the element to which the Action refers",
    cmd:       "the command which shall be invoked on the element",

    arg:       "a string containing JSON elements and their values"
               "the string will be split into pieces along comma"
               "the resulting arguments will be used in the invocation"
}
```


## <a name="c7"/> 7) SERVER, MASTER and MONITOR ( layer: BS / AS )

	<img src="http:img/websocket.png" style="float:right;width:400px;margin-left:10px"/>

	### HTTP
	
	The Berry Server layer acts like a traditional web server delivering files.<br/>
	Its URL handling is based on the following rules:
		
	* It redirects an empty URL to ``index.html``.
	* It treats URLs starting with ``/reg?`` as registration requests between a _Berry server_
	  and the _Master Berry server_.
	* It treats URLs starting with ``/api/`` as REST-API calls.
	* It treats an URL starting with ``/app/Master/`` as a reference to the _Berry Master_.
	* It treats all other URLs starting with ``/app/`` as a reference to your _application Berry_
	* It treats all other URLs as a reference to the generic client of the Berry framework.
	
	
	### Socket communication
	
	The Berry server establishes web socket communication with all clients and uses it for ..

	* direct responses to a client socket request, delivering hardware configuration and full state of the hardware
	* transmitting a list of active servers to a client
	* transmitting a list of inactive (startable) servers to the clients of the Master
	* direct responses to single ``getValue()`` requests of a client, delivering selected hardware status information
	* broadcasts to push changed state(s) of hardware elements to all connected clients

	
	### Master Berry
	
	__berry-frame__ comes with a __built-in Master application__ which is in principle a normal _berry_ but has some
	special functions for maintaining a list of currently active _berries_ and
	another list of _berries_ which can be started via the _Master Berry_.
	
	
	### Monitor
	
	__berry-frame__ has a watchdog mechanism which is called the _monitor_.
	
	If you start the _monitor_ it will regularly check if a _berry_ was terminated 
	and said that it wished to be restarted. This means, of course, that a _berry_
	going down for a restart must write suitable restart information to a place where
	the MONITOR will pick it up. This place is a file in BERRY_HOME named "restart.cmd".


	<img src="http:img/client.png" style="float:right;width:400px;margin-left:10px"/>

## <a name="c8"/> 8) CLIENT ( layer: BC / AC )

	The generic client receives a copy of the HWD from the server and uses the layout
	information (CSS) contained in the HWD to arrange the hardware elements on the screen,
	i.e. painting the front panel with all its elements.
	
	As a mnemonic it also displays a photo (or schematic diagram) of the physical hardware.
	
	It also adds a large heading (configurable in the HWD) above the front panel
	
	The client can contact the REST API of its server _berry_, show syntax help and send
	single REST requests in a separate browser tab to the server.
	
	On request of the server it helps to establish a web socket connection with the server.
	
	Whenever the server sends new socket messages with changed state information the client
	will update values or colors in the UI. The client can also play sound files if told by
	the server.
	
	Whenever the user interacts with the browser UI the client will construct a socket
	message for the server describing the event (like "button x pressed").
	
	The client monitors the socket connection and tries to re-establish it 
	if the server disappears unexpectedly.
	
	The client offers the possibility to STOP (permanently) or STOP-AND-RESTART its
	server _berry_.
	
	The client offers an UPDATE service to install the latest version of the __Berry framework__.
	
	Regarding the Raspberry Pi computer itself the client can issue a command which 
	will perform a REBOOT on the Raspi or a SHUTDOWN/HALT.
	
	The client can show the current MANUAL text (by clicking on the berry symbol in 
	its top left corner).
	
	The client can show the HWD file to the user (probably only developers
	and expert users will be interested in this).
	
	The client allows you to download a ZIP file of the currently running _berry_
	so that you can easily transfer it to another machine where the __Berry framework__ is installed.
	
	The client can show a nicley formatted PIN MAP which documents all physical
	connections to the hardware.
	
	The client can not only show the UI for the _berry_ it contacted initially. If a
	Berry Master is active and if the client´s server has connected to the Master, the client
	will be given a list of all active _berries_. It can then show their UIs as well.
	In fact it becomes a normal client for those servers - with the exception that it
	cannot stop or restart those other servers.
	

## <a name="c9"/> 9) TASK STRUCTURE
	
	The following diagram shows the task management of __berry-frame__.
	Tasks are marked with a "colored button".
	
	Basically you have the following tasks
	
	* the MONITOR (cycle of 5 seconds)
	* The WEB-SERVERS of all active _berries_ serving HTTP
	* The WEB-SERVERS of all active _berries_ listening to SOCKETS
	* The WEB_CLIENTS of all connected browsers listening to SOCKETS of each server they are connected to
	
	<img src="http:img/tasks.jpg" style="width:1200px;margin-left:10px"/>


## <a name="c10"/> 10) Installation

	<img src="http:img/directories.jpg" style="float:right;width:300px;margin-left:10px"/>

	You must have ``nodejs`` and ``npm`` installed on your machine.

	Create a home directory for your _berries_ (hereafter called 'BERRY_HOME') somewhere
	on your machine. BERRY_HOME will contain the _Berry framework_ itself and your own _Berry application(s)_.
	
	For an installation on Windows BERRY_HOME could be something like ___c:\berries___
	
	For an installation on the Raspi you could choose something like ___/home/pi/berries___

	Within BERRY_HOME call ``npm install berry-frame`` and wait until the process has finished.
	
	The copy the binaries for ``berry``, ``monitor`` and ``onreboot`` from ``node-Modules/berry-frame/bin``
	to BERRY_HOME and make them executable (on Windows copy the resp. ``*.bat`` files).
	
	Call ``./berry`` (on the Raspi) and wait until it has installed the additional modules
	which are only needed on the Raspberry Pi computer.

	__berry-frame__ can (and should!) be installed on _Windows_ and on your _Raspberry Pi_.
	
	Start with the installation on Windows. It is easier and faster and
	you will need it for the development of your _berries_ anyway.


### 10.1) Test on Windows

	<img src="http:img/install.jpg" style="float:right;width:200px;margin-left:10px"/>

	Unzip one or more of the sample_berries which come together with __berry-frame__
	into BERRY_HOME.
		
	Within BERRY_HOME call ``berry(.bat)`` and you should see a lengthy explanation
	on how to start __berry-frame__ from the command line.
	You will see chapters on Purpose, Version, Usage, Option, avialable _berries_
	and some Notes. The text will end with an error message because we did not 
	tell __berry-frame__ which of our _berries_ we want to start.
	
      Now let us call ``berry Hello -l 1"
	
	This starts the _Hello Berry_ and activates Logging.
	When the script starts, the first output line will contain the port number;
	in our case: 9001. The other lines of the Log tell you that __berry-frame__ found
	and parsed ``Hello.hwd``, assembled the modules necessary for the hardware
	configuration described in the HWD, started the Web Server (listening at port 9001),
	began to watch the state of a LED and tried to register itself at a _Berry Master_
	which it expected to find on port 9000. There was no response but 
	this is not a problem (it only means that you get no help for cooperation
	between multiple _berries_).
	
	__So, now the server is up and waiting for requests!__
		
	
      It is time to open your browser and point it to ``localhost:9001``.
	
	"localhost" means that the _Hello Berry server_ is running on the same machine as
	the browser. So the browser does not have to search within your LAN or even
	within the internet. Instead it will use the IP 127.0.0.1 which is by convention
	always the IP of the local machine where the browser is running.
	
	The browser will show a web page like this:
	
	<img src="img/screenHello.png"/>
	
	But what happened to the command line window with the server? It was flooded
	with a lot of text! __Scroll up__ in the terminal window and try to understand what happened.
	
	You will see:
	* First it got an empty HTTP request from the browser which it interpreted as a request for ``index.html``
	* Afterwards it received HTTP requests for ``BerryUI.css`` and some other files.
	  This happened because ``index.html`` references these files as it needs them to work properly.
	  When the browser sees those references it understands that it must request these
	  files from the server.
	* Then we see the first SOCKET request issued by the _Berry Client_: It tells
	  the "hardware" to "getAll". As a response the _Berry server_ sends a very long "hardware setup"
	  message which contains the hardware configuration of ``Hello``.
	* As a next step the server automatically sends the current state of its hardware.
	  In our case this is quite simple: The LED with the id 'led' is off, described by a value of 0.
	* The server tries another time to register itself at a Master but fails again
	  (it tries to register whenever a new client contacts the server).
	* Apart from that we see that the web client requested two images; one of them
	  can be seen on the right hand side of the UI; the other one is hidden at the moment.
	  
      Switch to the browser and click on the small gray "Hello" button at the bottom left.

	* This will show a descriptive text in a yellow box and a large table with the pinout.
	  And next to that table you will find the second image (the greenish raspi board) 
	  which had already been loaded in the step before.
	* And there is a list at the bottom of the table which explains every bit of the HWD.
	  All this information was prepared from the HWD config information which was initially
	  sent by the server. This means, on the other hand, that the client DID NOT HAVE TO TALK
	  TO THE SERVER when you pressed the gray 'Hello' button.

      Click the small gray "Hello" button again to hide the additional information.
	  
	* Again, this action did not affect the server. It is still sleeping and waiting
	  for client requests. So let´s wake it up!
	  
      Click on the "press and hold" button in the UI, hold it down for a moment,
      look at the server´s command window, and finally release the button.	  
	  
	* The browser detected the _button down_ event, sent it as a socket message to the
	  server as you can see in the server log lines.
	* Then the server talked to the (virtual) "Hardware" which switched the LED #15 to "ON"
	  (#15 is the GPIO number to which the LED is connected; note that GPIO #15
	  sits on physical pin #10, as the pinout told us).
	* Now the server sends a broadcast to all clients with LED "led" having a value of 1.
	* Your client gets the message and switches the LED to "green" because it learnt from the
	  former hardware setup message that the LED has a green color.
	* When you released the button another message travelled from the browser
	  to the server and the LED went OFF. This new state was transferred back to 
	  the browser and (only then!) the browser replaced the green LED color
	  by a dark gray to indicate that it is OFF now.
	  
      Now you should open a second client in another browser or at least in another
      browser tab, so that you can see everything simultaneously:
      The two browser screens and the server log. Then press the button
      in one of the windows and see what happens!
	  
	We recommend to experiment with this setting. You may also want to open the 
	_Hello Berry_ from your mobile device. In that case your PC and your mobile
	device should be connected via WiFi and you must know the name or IP addresse of
	your desktop computer where the _Hello Berry_ is running.

	Assuming that your Windows machine can be reached under 192.168.0.44
	you type http://192.168.0.44:9001 into the browser on your mobile device
	and you should see the user interface. In the command log you will see that 
	the server now talks to all three clients, eagerly propagating status changes
	of the LED induced by any client´s action to all of them in near real time.
	
      Finally you should try out the other functions of the client.

	* Click onto the green letters "HWD" in the lower part of the screen.
	* Click onto the red raspberry icon in the top left corner of the UI to see this manual.
	* Click onto the green letters "API" and change the URL in the new tab
	  to http://localhost:9001/api?id:"led",cmd:"toggle"
	  refreshing the page should give you values 0 and 1 alternatingly.
	  if you have a look at the web UI of ``Hello`` at the same time you 
	  will see the LED going on and off. The Log lines of the server will
	  tell you that it received an API request and that it changed the LED state.


### 10.2) Installation and Test on the Raspberry Pi

	This chapter describes the installation from scratch. If you have your Raspi already up
	and running you may want to skip the first parts.

	If you do not want to use WiFi you can ignore steps marked with [WiFi]. In that case you should
	follow the steps marked with [LAN]. If your Raspi has a RJE45 LAN connector we recommend 
	to use the LAN connection at least during installation as it is probably more stable and has 
	better performance.

      As usual you start on a Windosw PC to prepare the SD card:
	
	* download and install __Etcher__, __putty__ and __filezilla__ (or another ftp utility)
	* download __Raspbian lite__ from https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/
	* unzip the download
	* use Etcher to copy the unzipped img file to SD card
	* add an empty file named "ssh" to root partition of the SD card
	* [WiFi] add the file "wpa_supplicant.conf" to the root partition of the SD card. EXAMPLE:
	```
    country=DE # Your 2-digit country code
    ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
    network={
        ssid="YOUR_NETWORK_NAME"
        psk="YOUR_PASSWORD"
        key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
    }
	```
 
	* [WiFi] make sure you have a Raspi with built-in WiFi or use a Wifi USB stick
	* [LAN] connect the RJE45 jack to your local network

      Put the SD card into the Raspi and switch power on.

	* Stay on the PC and **connect to the Raspi via putty**
	* use the symbolic name RASPBERRYPI or search in your network for that name and note the IP
	  that was assigned to it by your network infrastructur.
	* Login with ``putty`` as user "pi" with password "raspberry".
	* call ``sudo raspi-config`` to configure localization, hardware interfaces, network name and other items
	* also select "expand filesystem" form the "advanced options"
	* if you chose to expand the file system you should reboot the Raspi and reconnect via putty

	* update and upgrade your system: ``sudo apt-get update`` then ``sudo apt-get upgrade`` then again ``sudo apt-get update``

	* ``sudo chmod +s /sbin/shutdown`` This step will allow _berries_ to shutdown the Raspi.
	
      Install __wiringPi__ and (if you wish) __Apache__
	
	* ``sudo apt-get install wiringpi``
	* ``sudo apt-get install apache2 php libapache2-mod-php``
	* ``cd /var/www/html``
	* ``sudo chown pi:pi . *``
 
      Now check if you see the Apache welcome page when calling your Raspi from the browser of your PC.
	
	Please note that a web server like Apache is _NOT REALLY NEEDED_ for Berry.
	If you do not install Apache you can run your _berry_ application on port 80
	which may be quite comfortable for the user and which is also a safe way
	to avoid problems with firewalls of network components.

      Now it is time to install Node.js

	Please note: If you have a Raspi Zero you have an armv61 processor.
	In that case you should install directly from the "dist" directory of nodejs.org the version 9.7.1 for armv61
````
    curl -o node-v9.7.1-linux-armv6l.tar.gz https://nodejs.org/dist/v9.7.1/node-v9.7.1-linux-armv6l.tar.gz
    tar -xzf node-v9.7.1-linux-armv6l.tar.gz
    sudo cp -r node-v9.7.1-linux-armv6l/* /usr/local/
````
	If you have a newer processor you can use ``apt`` to get the latest version of nodejs and npm:
	* ``sudo apt-get install nodejs npm``
	
	Install an __ftp server__
	* ``sudo apt-get install proftpd``
	* Open your ftp client on Windows and connect to the raspberry pi as user "pi"
	* this will help you later to transfer the sources of your _berry_ to the Raspi.
	
	Create you BERRY_HOME directory, e.g. ``/home/pi/berries``
	
	Install __berry-frame__ via ``npm install berry-frame``
	
	Copy the binaries (berry, monitor, onreboot) to BERRY_HOME and make them executable.

	Call ``./berry`` and wait until the second part of the installation has completed.

 	Call ``./berry`` again and you should only see the syntax help.

	Look into ``onreboot``, adapt it to your neds and call "sudo crontab -e";
	choose the "nano" editor and add the following line to the end of sudo´s crontab:
      ``@reboot /home/pi/berries/onreboot <your Berrie>``
	* start the monitor if you want: ``./monitor &``
	* Configure your hardware and make sure the HWD file fits the real hardware.
	* start your app with logging: ``./berry/ <your berry> -l 1 &``
	* or without logging: ``./berry <your berry>``
	* Use 'Hello' instead of your own App if you want to make sure that the installation is working.

## <a name="c11"/> 11) SAMPLE BERRIES

### Hello
      Light the LED while the button is held down.
	The most basic Berry one can think of. That´s why it is called 'Hello (World)'.
	
### Circle
      A nice game where circularly arranged buttons control corresponding lights.
	This a simple extension of ``Hello``. Change the assignment between buttons
	and LEDs, add/remove a button etc. to understand the mechanics of a HWD file.
	
### Dimmer
      Use a simple push button to dim a LED
	Useful as a tutorial. Introduces the concept of application specific Javascript code

### Weather
      Read a temperature sensor and trigger alarms
	Introduces a sensor which can continually deliver values.
	Shows how to establish automated server-side sensor polling by HWD declarations.
	Could be extended to more sensors.	
		
	<img src="http:img/aBerry.png" style="float:right;width:200px;margin-left:10px"/>

## <a name="c12"/> 12) CREATING A BERRY

	We recommend to start working under Windows. Once your _berry_ runs in the emulation
	you transfer the files of your _berry_ to the Raspi and execute it there.
	
	
###	12.1) Decide on the hardware and the functionality of your _berry_

	We want to have a push button and a LED. The LED shall be ON while the button is held down.
	It shall be OFF while the button is UP.
	
	As this is the most basic application we can think of, let us call it "Hello".
	
	The name "Hello" is, precisely spoken, the name of a _Berry Type_.
	
	What does that mean? Well, you could have __two__ Raspberry computers with each one running
	your glorious "Hello" application. Then you have two INSTANCES of your APPLICATION TYPE.
	If you now have a web client which connects to both "Hello" _berries_ we
	would like to have a separate NAME for each INSTANCE.
	
	``berry/bin/berry Hello -n World``  
	will create an instance of `Hello` named `World`.
	
	`berry/bin/berry Hello -n Moon`  
	will create another instance of `Hello` named `Moon`.
	
	
### 12.2) Describe your configuration in a HWD file

	Create the new subdirectory ``Hello`` under your "berries" home directory.
	Create a HWD config file in ``Hello\server\Hello.hwd``.
	Decide on the port number to use and put that number into the HWD at the ``port`` property.
	
	To make life easy for you we have already provided a 
	<a href="/app/Hello/server/Hello.hwd" target="hwd">file named Hello.hwd</a>.
	
      Read that file carefully. Try to add another button and another LED!
	
	
### 12.3) Prepare the client
	Create ``Hello\audio`` and ``Hello\img``.
	
	Make a nice photo of your hardware or use a tool like "fritzing" to draw a schematic diagram
	and put it into ``Hello\img\Hello.jpg``.
	Note that the name of this image (without path) is referenced in the HWD file.

### 12.4) Develop your application logic
	In this simple exampe we do not need that.
	
### 12.5) Start your _berry_ on Windows

	Lean back and go to BERRY_HOME. Call ``berry/bin/berry Hello`` and wait what happens.
	If you do not see error messages complaininig about invalid JSON syntax in ``Hello.hwd``
	you can now open a browser on the defined port like this:
	``http://localhost:9001´´

### 12.6) Improve your _berry_
	Change the HWD or your JS applicatiion code. Then press the blue button in the client.
	The client will tell the server to terminate and restart. __Only after the restart__ the
	server will load your changed code and you see the effect.

### 12.7) Go to the target platform

	If everything runs fine in the emulation, copy your _berry_ into the BERRY_HOME
	directory on the Raspberry Pi (using ftp)) and test it there. 
	Don´t forget to start the __monitor__.
	
	If you make changes to the code or to the HWD file you can use the blue RESTART button in 
	the Web UI to restart the server of your _berry_ (if the monitoring script is running).
	
	If you keep your master version on Windows you must make sure that a changed file
	is transferred to the Raspi before you execute it there.

	Once everything seems ok you should also provide a ZIP file for your _berry_ so that
	interested users can download it and duplicate it onto their machines.
	The script ``berry\bin\zip_berries.bat`` will help you in creating the ZIP.
